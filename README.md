Week 1–2: Planning Stage  
- I thought deeply about the kind of application I wanted to create.  
- I had many ideas, but they seemed difficult to execute, and I kept wondering whether I could pull them off or not.  
- Eventually, I realized what I truly wanted the Queen's Stage application.  
- So, I started planning what would make my application, Queen's Stage, stand out.  
- I worked on the design, color scheme, and other details.  

Week 3–4: Research 
- I researched similar projects that I could use as inspiration but aimed to create something unique and spectacular.  
- I identified the **target audience** and their needs.  
- I chose the tools, technologies, and platforms to use, including **Flutter** for Queen's Stage.  

Week 5–6: Installing Flutter and Android Studio and Testing 
- Initially, installing Flutter was challenging because it required multiple connections to set up.  
- Next was Android Studio, which was also difficult to install.  
- Finally, after many attempts, I managed to install everything.  
- However, whenever I clicked something, additional installations were required.  
- I sought help from Keith, and thankfully, I was able to complete the installation without repeating the process.  
- Afterward, I searched for codes to try, and luckily, they worked and functioned as expected.  

Week 7: Creating the UI  
- For the UI, I initially created sketches since I wasn’t informed that there were other tools available for it. 
- Drawing the designs helped me clarify my ideas.  
- Unfortunately, during my presentation, I didn’t have a proper UI to showcase.  

Week 7: Presentation/Approval
- I presented my application with nervousness and shyness, but I was able to finish my proposal.  
- Thank you, Sir, for approving my proposal!  

Week 8: Continuation of the Application 
- Now, I’ve started improving and modifying the design and code.  
- It’s challenging, but I’m determined to keep going and make it work.
